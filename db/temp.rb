In the foothills of Mount Vesuvius is a land rich in organic substances and minerals that when combined with the nearby Mediterranean Sea, provide some of the best soil in the entire country of Italy. This soil is where San Marzano tomatoes thrive, giving chefs the best sauce tomatoes in the world.  Compared to the more common Roma (plum) tomatoes, the San Marzano have thicker flesh, fewer seeds and a stronger, less sweet and acidic taste - bittersweet, like great chocolate.  This bright red tomato, whose name denotes both its origin and variety, is harvested only by hand due to its delicate nature.  The San Marzano is picked, peeled and packed from August through September, sometimes later.  So prized are they, that in 1996, San Marzano tomatoes were granted Protected Designation of Origin status by the European Union and only cans that display the DOP designation are guaranteed to be genuine San Marzano tomatoes.

Transitioning to Pet’s Banquet™ Dog Food
When it comes to transitioning to Pet’s Banquet Dog Food, it is important to gradually mix in a little bit of Pet's Banquet Dog Food with your dog’s present food. We recommend you do this because of the difference in nutrition levels and the dog’s need to adapt to the changes. The transition should happen gradually over a week.
